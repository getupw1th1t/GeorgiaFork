Georgia is a theme for foobar2000 designed to change dynamically based on album art. Itâ€™s original purpose was to be used on a HTPC so it has large album artwork, plenty of logos and other eye candy. Over time it has evolved to add a playlist and other features which make it perfectly suitable for using on a desktop as well. It can be run in a window and it resizes pretty well, but it usually looks best when run maximized to show off all your big beautiful artwork. My hope is it provides a modern take on the joy of holding a vinyl sleeve or looking through a CD booklet.
