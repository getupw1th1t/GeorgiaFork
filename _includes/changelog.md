## v2.0.2 - 2020-03-26

### Changes
 - Rewrote volume bar code and removed tooltips in favor of [on screen volume display](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2282004/112571697-9cd98f00-8db6-11eb-99d5-6d4858bf9b93.png).
 - Prefetching first 10 artworks in playlist
 - config file now contains a `defaultSortString` value which will apply to all playlists generated by hyperlinks, or by selecting files in the library
 - Added limited support for foo_discogs and 3 values in the metadata grid ("Label", "Catalog #", and "Release Country") were updated to their new defaults. If you need to reset these consult your backed up config file.

### Added
 - Spinning cdArt. This is somewhat experimental, increases CPU usage, and depending on screen resolution it can increase foobar's memory footprint up to 1GB.
 - Option to always show bitrate and sample rate in playlist (thanks noblesigma)
 - Smooth scrolling in the playlist

### Fixed
 - In some cases, embedded lyrics cannot be retrieved by foobar. Added an onscreen explanation of how to fix this problem.

 - Replicated theme background on theme startup so theme never shows the ugly white background
