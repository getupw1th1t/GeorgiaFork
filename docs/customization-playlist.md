## Playlist

The playlist can be extensively customized.

### Playlist Settings Menu

There is an extensive list of options that can be enabled and disabled in the Options >> Playlist Settings menu:

Sizes for the playlist can be adjusted if headers/rows are too big or too small, if you prefer compact headers, and more.

### Playlist Context Menu

While most of the visual aspects of the playlist can be controlled by the Playlist Settings menu, many options related to functionality of the Playlist are only available within the right-click context menu.
