# Customizing Georgia's Look and Feel

Georgia has a ton of different ways you can customize the theme so that it looks and acts the precise way you want it to. Many of the customization options here are available entirely from the Options menu or various right click context menus, but some of them may require editing the [configuration file](configuration.html).

## Artwork

See the [artwork documentation](artwork.html) for more information on configuring how artwork is displayed within Georgia.

## Customizing other areas
