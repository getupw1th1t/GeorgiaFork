## Configuration File

Since version 2.0 Georgia has included a configuration file named `georgia-config.jsonc`. This file contains various configuration settings for the theme which can be edited to change the appearance and functionality.

### Editing

The configuration file format is [JSONC](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/json#_json-with-comments), JSON with comments. This file can be edited in any text editor, but I recommend VS Code since it handles the files natively.
