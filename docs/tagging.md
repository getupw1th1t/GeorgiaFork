## Tagging Your Files

Georgia looks and functions best when you tag your files liberally with lots of metadata. I have very strict standards in my library about tag field names, but I understand that no one else will follow the same standards, so this page will document some best practices and also discuss how to adjust the theme to use your own personal field names.

### Taggers to Use

I personally recommend the [foo_musicbrainz](https://www.foobar2000.org/components/view/foo_musicbrainz) tagger component as it is integrated with foobar2000, and the default tag field names are the same ones this theme has configured by default. Also, I'm the maintainer of foo_musicbrainz, and future updates to that component will be reflected in Georgia as well. Synergy!

There are plenty of other great taggers out there, but all of them will differ from the field names used in Georgia in minor/major ways. Fortunately you don't need to give up your favorite tagger or alter your workflow as you can easily edit the fields used throughout Georgia in the [config file](configuration.html).

### Metadata Fields

See [Title-Formatting fields](configuration-titleformatting.html) for a detailed list of every Title-Formatting string property Georgia uses, where they are used, and what tag name that property corresponds to by default.
