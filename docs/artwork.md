## Artwork

Georgia was designed from the ground up to display big/beautiful artwork front and center. It also makes copious use of "fanart" wherever possible including the display of cd/vinyl art, band logos, label/publisher logos, country flags, and more. Because of this, there are numerous options governing the display of the various kinds of artwork and images available.

#### A note on Caching

All album art, cd/vinylArt and band logos are cached by Georgia so that it does not need to continually read from disk. Images are loaded by the theme, scaled down to a manageable size (to increase speed and lower disk usage) and then the handle to the original image is free'd at which point you could overwrite/replace/delete the original file. This means that external changes to displayed images will not be reflected in the theme without reloading it through the right click menu, or by double-clicking anywhere on the panel background (not a button, image or either the playlist or library).
